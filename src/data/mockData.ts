export const executiveSummary = `Your roadmap is built around three pillars: (1) exceptional grades and test scores, (2) a sharp, coherent story around law, justice and AI, and (3) evidence of real-world impact through projects, internships and writing. Whenever something changes—like your LNAT score, a new internship, or a missed deadline—you can tell your report using the chat. We use that new context to adjust universities, tasks and timelines.

As an organisation, we care most about truthful, on-ground information, even if someone else is helping you with applications. That's why this report connects you to EduMentors—students who actually study this course, in this university, in this city and country—so you aren't relying only on brochures and marketing pages.`;
